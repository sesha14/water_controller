# water_controller
This is a microcontroller-based water-level controller-cum-motor protector to solve
the problem water overflow from the overhead tank in our households.

The microcontroller based project controls ‘on’ and ‘off’ conditions of the motor that
pushes water into tank depending upon the level of water in the tank. Thus, water wastage
can be reduced to an extent. The status is displayed on an LCD module. The circuit also
protects the motor from high voltages, low voltages, fluctuations of mains power and dry
running.
